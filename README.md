### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am currently an administrative specialist with the Commonwealth of Kentucky. I am learning coding for fun to automate the more repetitive tasks of my job using Python and VBA and to begin delving into data analytics using Python, and a bit of web development with HTML/CSS/JavaScript for fun. This GitHub is a way to track my pet projects, and possibly launch a career change into data analytics should the opportunity present itself.

Any questions or comments about this GitHub and its contents can be directed to adamsdataanalytics@gmail.com.
